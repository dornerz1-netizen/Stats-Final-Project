TITLE: Party Affiliation and Elections Run Among New Jersey Legislators
Introduction

Introduction: In the social world, elections shape which voices, priorities, and policies become part of government, AND legislators often differ in their electoral experiences depending on the political environments they navigate. Party affiliation is one of the most central identities in American politics, AND it could reasonably influence how often a legislator has run for office. BUT it is not clear whether legislators from one party tend to run in more elections than those from the other party, especially within the context of the New Jersey Legislature. THEREFORE, this project analyzes whether a relationship exists between a legislator’s party affiliation and the number of elections they have run, using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and a Welch Two Sample t-test to evaluate the difference in means.

Data and Methods
This project uses data collected on 120 members of the New Jersey Legislature. Each legislator was documented through publicly available characteristics, including demographic information, district attributes, and political history. The sample includes both chambers (Assembly and Senate) and reflects the most recent legislative session at the time of data collection. Data were hand-recorded following the structured workbook template and later imported into R for analysis. The first variable in this analysis is party affiliation, coded as a binary categorical variable. Legislators were coded as 1 = Democrat or 1 = Republican, depending on their identified party. In the sample, 59% of legislators were Democrats and 41% were Republicans. Party was measured using official state legislative listings and does not involve any additional assumptions. Party is treated as a categorical grouping variable when comparing means. The second variable is elections run, operationalized as the total number of elections in which each legislator has participated. This variable is measured at the ratio level. According to the descriptive statistics in Table 1, legislators ran in an average of 3.75 elections (SD = 2.90), with a minimum of 1 election and a maximum of 15. Elections run is appropriate for this analysis because it provides a numerical indicator of political experience. The research question guiding this project is: What is the relationship between a legislator’s party affiliation and the number of elections they have run? To answer this, a Welch Two Sample t-test was used to compare the mean number of elections run between Democrats and Republicans. A boxplot was also created to visualize group differences.

Results
Table 1 presents a boxplot comparing elections_run across the two party groups. Visually, the distributions for Democrats and Republicans look very similar, with both parties clustering around 2–4 elections. Table 2 shows the group means: Republicans averaged 3.69 elections and Democrats averaged 3.84. The Welch two-sample t-test shows t = –0.27965, p = 0.7803, and a 95% confidence interval from –1.19 to 0.89. Because this confidence interval includes zero and the p-value is far above 0.05, there is no statistically significant difference between Democrats and Republicans. In plain language: party does not appear to be related to elections_run in this dataset. The t-test assumes independent observations, a continuous outcome variable, and reasonably similar variance across groups. The independence assumption is met because each legislator is an individual case. Elections_run is a numeric variable, satisfying the continuous outcome requirement. The variances between parties appear reasonably similar based on the boxplot in Table 1 and the mechanics of the Welch test, which adjusts for unequal variances if they exist. Therefore, the assumptions of the test are reasonably met for this analysis.
Discussion
This analysis suggests that party affiliation does not meaningfully shape how many elections New Jersey legislators have run. In the social world, this implies that both Democrats and Republicans arrive in office with similar electoral experience, at least when measured by how many campaigns they have participated in. This challenges common assumptions that one party may attract more career politicians while the other may attract more newcomers. Instead, both parties appear to draw legislators with comparable backgrounds in electoral participation.
One limitation of this study is that elections run does not distinguish between winning and losing elections, primary versus general elections, or the political competitiveness of districts. A legislator could have run many times in a safe seat or only a few times in a highly competitive district. Incorporating measures of district competitiveness or electoral margins could improve the analysis. Overall, working through this project provided a meaningful opportunity to connect concepts from class with real-world political behavior. Collecting the dataset, cleaning variables, building a replication package, and interpreting the statistical results helped deepen my understanding of how quantitative analysis can clarify questions about politics. The process reinforced how important it is to carefully operationalize variables and rely on appropriate statistical tools when drawing conclusions about the social world.
